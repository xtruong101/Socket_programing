How to run server and client on your Vscode?

Run this command in your vscode terminal:

g++ serverTCP.cpp -o server.exe -lws2_32

g++ clientTCP.cpp -o client.exe -lws2_32

Then you will have two files. They are server.exe and client.exe

Run server.exe first to initiate your server: 

./server.exe

Then run client.exe: 

./client.exe

Note: **server and client must have the same IP/port!**
